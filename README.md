## Creative Process
For One of my interviews they asked me to make a modal and overlay. The requirements were as follows

1. Go to kohls.com and add at least 2 products to your cart. Then return to the home page.
2. Write a JavaScript snippet that can be run in the console of the browser that does the following:
    1. Extracts the number of items in the cart, the cart total, and the item images from the page. Store them in variables.
    2. Creates a trigger that activates when the user scrolls into the bottom 10% of the page.
    3. The trigger should show a centered overlay on top of the site that displays the information gathered above and two buttons:
         1, one button should close the overlay
         2, the other should take the user to the cart page
    4. Behind the overlay add a semiÂ­-transparent black background that obscures the site.
    5. The overlay should be able to trigger multiple times if dismissed.
3. The overlay should have a style consistent with the website. Design matters.

Bonus: Explain potential problems that could arise if this snippet had more or less than the 2 items in the cart. How would you address those problems?

### Progress
The time limit was 72 hours. So I had to send the assignment before it was complete. Now I continue working on it I'll be releasing videos on my LinkedIn. Explaining what went well and what went wrong.
